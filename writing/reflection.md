## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, with your response.

### First Tool: Metagenomics

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

 Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.
 It is an application for pathogen identification from the environmental samples and directly
 accessing the genetic content of the organism during emerging pandemics situations.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

Metagenomics uses sequencing, that is cost effective, that does not require reference
sequence for analysis.
Metagenomics has been used for:
  rapid identification and quick characterization of the first few cases of COVID19
  examining the SARS-CoV-2 with other co-infections in nasopharyngeal throat swabs of patients  
  identification of the intermediate host in transferring the infection to human body
  screening of the homologous sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in other organisms
  the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in human faecal microbiome alterations
  clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection with bacterial co-infections

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

This method was necessary to develop because it's findings have helped for better
isolation of COVID19 patients with different symptoms.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

I don't feel that there is any undesirable consequences that could result from this
misuse of this tool ethically. However, it does present the possibility of misuse
by developing an understanding of how intermediate host in transferring infection. An
understanding of this could be misused in a way that the person discovers the
easiest way to transfer a known virus and decides to use that to make the virus grow
and infect more people.


### Second Tool: Computer Aided Drug Design

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?

This method uses the field of bioinformatics in order to help in drug design. This
method has been used during COVID19 for structure-based drug design, network-based
drug design towards the identification of potential drug candidates in SARS-CoV-2 by using the
bioinformatics tools and software.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?

This method uses Computer aided and bioinformatics in order to help in the process
of drug develop or design. It helps in the understanding of complex biological
processes to improve drug discovery. It also has helped the development of
digital repositories for the study of chemical interaction relationships, designing compounds with
unusual physicochemical characteristics as well as tools for systematic assessment of
potential lead candidates. The develop of Computer Aided Drug Design has benefits
like cost saving, in-sight knowledge of drug-receptor interaction, and speeding
up drug discovery and development.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?

This method is necessary to develop because drug design is very challenging, expensive,
time consuming and an integrated rising discipline. It helps to produce possible
solutions faster and cheaper. The use of a computer can be very beneficial and
often more effective than human.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?

Some consequences that could result from the misuse of this method is if there is
an issue in the computer program and it develops a drug wrongly. It could also
be purposely altered to affect a drug develop a certain way. Doing this could lead to
serious side effects in drugs or the potential to purposely try to harm someone
by developing a drug that intentionally harms human body.
